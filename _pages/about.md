My research uses network analysis methods to map agricultural trade networks. Specifically I want to understand how border closures, disease outbreaks, droughts, and climatic factors affect regional trade in West Africa. She holds a Master of Sustainable Development Practice from the University of Florida. 

My bachelors degree is in Ecology and my masters degree is in Sustainable Development Practice. Proir to joining the PhD program I was a project and research assistant at the USAID-funded Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, painting and jogging.
